1843. Lesson. "Histoire Naturelle des Zoophytes; Acalephes,' a thick 8vo volume, forming part of
the ‘ Nouvelles Suites à Buffon."
This work is one of the most useful, and yet one of the most provoking, in its department
of natural history; useful, because it brings together, verbatim, everything that has been
written upon the Medusæ in France; provoking, because every attempt in it at an
arrangement or digest of the matter so collected serves only to make the obscure more
obscure, and the crude more crude. It is executed without any judgment, though with
considerable industry. Of what has been done outside of France it is a most imperfect
account. Nevertheless, for the present, it is indispensable to the student of the Medusæ,
and includes the fullest list published of species and references. A few plates in which
some interesting species are figured are appended. I have compiled the following
Catalogue of Medusæ, either naked-eyed, or possibly so, enumerated by Lesson, with the
localities given in his work, and the name of the original observer.
