the flames of a national war in the Peninsula.
Through all the weakness and submission of the
last century he still discerned the traces of en-
ergy and resolution in the Spanish character.
The timidity of its foreign conduct, the abuses
of its internal administration, he justly ascribed
to the corruption of the nobles or the imbecil-
ity of the court. His generals had transmitted
daily accounts of the alarming fermentation
which seemed to prevail, especially in the lower
classes of the community; and he rightly con-
cluded that he would be involved in inextrica-
ble embarrassment if, on the side where he had
so long been entirely secure, there should arise
a contest animated by the indignant feelings of
a nation hitherto virgin to revolutionary pas-
sions. His instructions to Murat, accordingly,
at this period, were to conduct himself with the
utmost circumspection; to avoid everything
which might excite an angry feeling or pro-
voke a hostile collision; to strengthen his mili-
tary hold of the country; but do nothing which
might disturb the pacific negotiations by which
he hoped, without drawing a sword, to obtain,
in a few days, the whole objects of his ambi-
tion.*+
