Lord Wellesley to Secret Committee, June, 1804, Well
Desp., iv., 115, 127.
† “The necessity of repelling Holkar's banditti from the
frontier of Hindostan, and of reducing him to a peaceable
conduct, will not lead to any serious interruption of peace,
and will probably tend to consolidate our connexion with
Scindiah. The commander-in-chief, with the greater part
of the main army in Hindostan, has returned to the canton-
ment of Cawnpore, and my attention is now directed to the
desirable object of withdrawing the whole army from the field,
and reducing the military charges."—Lord WELLESLEY to
Lord CASTLEREAGH, 9th July, 1804, Well. Desp., iv., 131.
† Colonel Fawcett's Desp., 22d May, 1804, Well. Desp.,
