The two principal systems of the Medieval School of Indian
Logic, viz., the Jaina Logic and the Buddhist Logic, have been
thoroughly expounded here by bringing together a mass of infor-
mation derived from several rare Jaina Manuscripts and Tibetan
xylographs hitherto inaccessible to many. In the appendices a
short and general history of the University of Nalanda and the
Royal University of Vikramsila has also been given.
