† In the preceding account of the battle of Marengo, the
author has corrected the various French and German ac-
counts of the engagement hitherto published, by some man-
uscript notes by General Kellerman, who had so great a
share in achieving the success, written on the margin of the
collection of the various accounts of the battle contained in
the “Mémorial du Depôt de la Guerre," iv., 269, 343. For
tis valuable manuscript notes the author is indebted to
the kindness of his esteemed friend Captain Basil Hall.

6 Napoleon, at the same time, was perfectly aware of the
immense service rendered by the charge of Kellerman, for
he said in the evening to Bourrienne, “ That little Kellerman
made a happy charge. He struck in at the critical moment;
we owe him much. On what trivial events do affairs de-
pend!"—BOURRIENNE, iv., 124.
