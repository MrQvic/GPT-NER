† When General'Harris advanced against Seringapatam,
in 1799, his army was composed of 35,000 fighting men and
120,000 attendants; and when Marquis Hastings took the
field in 1817 against the Mahrattas, his regular forces,
amounting to 110,000 men, were swelled by above 500,000
camp followers; among whom, chiefly of the lower grades in
society, and persons habituated to the humblest fare, the
cholera made the most unheard-of ravages.—MALTE BRUN,
