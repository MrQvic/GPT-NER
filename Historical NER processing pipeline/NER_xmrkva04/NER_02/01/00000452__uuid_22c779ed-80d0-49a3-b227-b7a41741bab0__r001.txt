† “I trembled," says Jomini, speaking in the person of
Napoleon, “lest 150,000 of those mediators had appeared
on the Elbe, which would have plunged me in the greatest
difficulties. I there saw that I had placed myself at the
mercy of my enemies. More than once I then regretted
having suffered myself to be drawn on into those remote
and inhospitable countries, and received with so much as-
perity all who sought to portray its danger. The cabinet
of Vienna had then a safer and more honourable opportunity
of re-establishing its preponderance than that which it
chose in 1813, but it had not resolution enough to profit by
it, and my firm countenance proved my salvation."—JOMINI,
