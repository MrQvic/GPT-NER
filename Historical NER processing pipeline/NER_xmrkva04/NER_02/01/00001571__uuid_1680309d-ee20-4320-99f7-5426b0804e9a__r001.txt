t In describing this battle, Lord Hutchinson, who wit-
nessed it, stated, in his official despatches to the British gov-
ernment, “I want words sufficiently strong to describe the
valour of the Russians, and which alone would have ren-
dered their success undoubted, if courage alone could se-
cure victory; but, whatever may be the event, the officers
and men of the Russian army have done their duty in the
noblest manner, and are justly entitled to the praise and ad-
miration of every person who was witness of their conduct."
