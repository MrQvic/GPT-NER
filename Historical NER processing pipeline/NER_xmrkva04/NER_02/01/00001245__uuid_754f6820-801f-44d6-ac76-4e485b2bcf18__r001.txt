† During this desperate struggle between the Passarge,
a conflict of some importance, but overlooked amid the
shock of such mighty hosts, took place on the banks of the
Narew. Tolstoy had there gained some successes over
Massena, and, in particular, made himself master of the in-
trenched camp of Borki; but the French having at-
June 13. tacked it some days after with increased forces, it
again fell into their hands, and the Russians, follow-
ing the retreat of their principal army, had retired from
Ostrolenka towards Ticoizin, when the armistice of Tilsit
put a period to their operations.—DUMAS, xix., 41, 43.
