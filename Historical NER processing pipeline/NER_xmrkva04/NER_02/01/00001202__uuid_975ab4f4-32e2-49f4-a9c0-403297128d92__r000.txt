This theory of permanency in divine arrangements which characterizes the O. T., is
sadly disarranged by the theory of the 13/2 division in the N. T. “And his tail draweth the
third part of the stars of heaven" (Rev. 12, 4) or the 2 against 1, and 3 against 2 of the
gospel. But this is to occur in the time of the inverted pyramid. Hence the Assyrian
sculptures have representations of candlesticks which differ from the Jewish pattern, in
which all the flames burn at the end of a single branch,—in this that the branches, with
the exception of the lowest, are intertwined. The latter figure shows a pillar (the tree)
from which to the right and left issues a single branch below; then follow 4 branches, on
both sides, intertwined two by two; the tree is crowned by a sun of 22 rays (the Mosaic
22 bowls) and surrounding the latter are 7 independent flames, one of which touches the
flame of the left upper branch. 46
