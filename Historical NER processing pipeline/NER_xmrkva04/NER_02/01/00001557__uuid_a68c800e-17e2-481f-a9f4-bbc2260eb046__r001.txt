of a fine rose colour. They reach to a level with the margin of the umbrella. The specimen
I have described was a little more than an inch in length, exclusive of its tentacula. It was
sluggish, possibly owing to fatigue, as it had probably been in the tow-net during a greater
part of the night. I have represented it in Plate III, fig. 1, a, of the natural size; fig. 1, b, is an
outline showing the arrangement of the muscular bands; fig. 1, c, represents a portion of the
peduncle laid open, with two of the ovarian masses, and the fimbriated lips, also a part
of the border of the umbrella with its tentacula; fig. 1, d, is a portion of one of the tentacles,
magnified; and fig. 1, e, a portion of the tissue of one of the muscular bands, as seen under a
high power.
Eschscholtz has strangely placed this Medusa as an associate of Dian√¶a viridula, in his
genus Eirene.
