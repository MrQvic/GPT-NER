It deals with certain interesting problems in n-dimensional
Geometry, the method adopted being one of deduction from first
principles. The second part contains certain interesting results
in the Geometry of Hyper-spaces, which is now recognised as an
indispensable part of that science with extensive applications in
mathematical Physics. In the treatment of subject-matter, the
easiest possible methods have been adopted, so that the dis-
cussions can be followed by an ordinary student of Mathematics
without a knowledge of Higher Mathematics.
