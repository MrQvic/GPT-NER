“So entirely devoted am I," said Lord Wellesley, “ to
the indispensable duty of providing a large force in the field
and an efficient system of alliance, that my estimate of
character, and my sentiments of respect, and even of affec-
tion, in this country, are regulated absolutely by the degree
of zeal and alacrity which l find in those who are to assist me
in this great struggle. Nor can I conceive a more firm
foundation, or a more honourable bond of friendship, than a
common share in the labours, difficulties, and honour of de-
fending and saving so valuable a part of the British Empire.
This is the nature of the connexion which I seek with your
lordship, and these are the sentiments which render me so
averse to those men who appear negligent, or reluctant, or
irresolute in a conjuncture which ought to extinguish all
partialities, all private resentments and affections, and unite
and animate all talents and exertions in one common cause."
