“The Emperor Alexander," says Boutourlin, “felt that
the alliance concluded at Tilsit, cemented at Erfurth, as
soon as it ceased to be conformable to the interests of Na-
poleon, would come to an end; and that the grand crisis was
approaching which was destined either to consolidate the
universal empire which the French emperor was endeav-
ouring to establish on the Continent, or to break the chains
which retained so many Continental states under his rule.
Determined never to submit to any condition inconsistent
with the honour of his crown, the Emperor of Russia re-
garded the rupture as near and unavoidable, and thence-
forward applied himself silently to organize the immense
resources of his states, to resist the danger which was ap-
proaching: a danger which promised to be more terrible,
that Russia would have to sustain it, to all appearance
alone, against the accumulated forces of the greater part of
Europe."—BOUTOURLIN, i., 45.
