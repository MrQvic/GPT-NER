† The ablest writers of France fully admit the insane de-
sire for foreign warfare which at that period had seized on
its government. “Every one," says Marshal St. Cyr,“ of
the least foresight, at the close of 1792, was aware of the
danger which menaced the Republic, and was krt in as-
tonishment, I will not say at the imprudence, bet tze folly
of the convention, which, instead of seeking to diminish the
number of its enemies, seemed resolved to augment them by
successive insults, not merely against all kings, but every
existing government. A blind and groundless confidence
had taken possession of their minds; they thought only of
dethroning kings by their decrees, leaving the armies on
which the Republic depended in a state of entire destitu-
tion."— ST. CYR, Memoirs, i., 19, 20.
