† The French lost in the battle of Echmuhl about six
thousand men. The bulletin stated the general loss from
the opening of the campaign, at twelve hundred killed,
and four thousand wounded; which, according to their usu-
al proportion of admitting only a fourth part of its real
amount, would make it about twenty thousand men, which
was probably very near the mark. The Austrians, in the
whole five days, lost in killed, wounded, and prisoners,
about thirty thousand, and one hundred pieces of cannon.—
