Since the direction of the diffusion changes sign with
changing concentration, the criterion of equilibrium camot be
a uniform osmotic pressure and the explanation of van't
Hoff can hold as a first approximation only for solutions in
which the volume occupied by the solute may be neglected.
What the real criteria for equilibrium are, is an interesting
problem for which no satisfactory answer has yet been found.
