period (800 A.D.—1200 A.D.) deals with the mantras and the
aphorisms of Assam. In the third or Pre-Vaishnava period
(1200 A.D.—1450 A.D.) the translation of the Puranas and the
Ramayana in Assamese was taken in hand for the first time by
writers like Hema Saraswati, Madhaba Kandali and Pitambara
Dwija to prepare the way for Vaishnavism. In the fourth period
or the Vaishnavite period (1450 A.D.—1800 A.D.) in which all
the great writers of ancient Assamese literature flourished, the
literature was chiefly employed for the propagation of Vaishna-
vism. The fifth period or the period of expansion begins about
1600 A.D. with the consolidation of the Ahom power in the
country and extends up to 1800 A.D. about which time the
country came under the British rule. This period was marked
by great literary activity. The sixth period commences in 1800
A.D. and continues up to the present time.
