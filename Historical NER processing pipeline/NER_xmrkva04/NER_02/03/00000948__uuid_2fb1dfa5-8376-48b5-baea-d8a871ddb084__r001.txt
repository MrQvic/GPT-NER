† Another arrêt, at the same period, regulated the costume
of the persons employed in the legal profession. The robes
of the judges were ordered to be red, and those of the bar
black. During the Revolution, all the distinguishing marks
had been abolished. The black robe which Molière had so
exquisitely ridiculed had given way to the costume of the
sans-culottes. At the same time, the old habiliments at the
Messe Rouge were re-established, and the service was cel-
ebrated by the Archbishop of Paris. Everything breathed
a return to the ancient régime. Cambacérès was the great
promoter of these changes, well aware of the importance
of whatever strikes the eye on the inconsiderate multitude.
