rand will tell you what to do, and what has been arranged
between the Emperor of Russia and me. I am about to
give repose to the army in the country we have conquered,
and to enforce payment of the contributions; that is the
only difficulty which I anticipate; but regulate yourself by
this principle, that I will on no account be again drawn into
the contest. Never speak of war; in conversation, studious-
ly avoid everything which may give offence; contravene no
usage; ridicule no custom. Neglect nothing which may
draw closer and perpetuate the bonds of alliance now con-
tracted with that country"â€”SAVARY, iii., 96, 97, and
1 HARD., X., 29.
