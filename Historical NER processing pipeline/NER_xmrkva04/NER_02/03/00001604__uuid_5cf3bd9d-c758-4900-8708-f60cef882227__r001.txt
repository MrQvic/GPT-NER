To such a height had the spirit of Suchet's troops aris-
en, that an Italian soldier named Bianchini, who, at the as-
sault of Fort Olivo, had pursued the Spanish garrison to the
foot of the walls of the town, and made some prisoners there,
being brought before the general-in-chief, and asked what
recompense he desired, answered, “The honour," said he,
“of mounting first to the assault of Taragona." On the
28th of June, this brave man, now promoted to the rank of a
sergeant, presented himself in full dress before the general,
and claimed the honour which had been promised him. He
obtained it: was seen at the head of the forlorn hope; re-
ceived a wound, but still pressed on, encouraging his com-
rades to follow him; was twice again wounded without
stopping; and at length fell, pierced to the heart by a mus-
ket-ball, near the summit of the breach! The spirit of
Rome is not extinct in Italy: it is only obscured by the cor-
ruptions which have overspread the higher ranks from long-
continued civilization.—See SUCHET's Memoirs, ii., 100,
