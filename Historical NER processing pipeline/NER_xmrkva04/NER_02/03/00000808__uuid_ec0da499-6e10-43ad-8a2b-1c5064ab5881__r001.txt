* The 47th Bulletin admits a loss of 800 killed and 2000
wounded on the part of the French at Golymin and Pul-
tusk; and as their usual practice was to allow only a loss of
a third to a fourth of its real amount, this would seem to im-
ply that they lost on these occasions at least 10,000 or
12,000 men.—See 47th Bulletin in Camp. en Prusse, iii., 222.
