Sir A. Berriedale Keith (Edinburgh):—“............a very useful aid to
appreciation of the complex and unsatisfactory position resulting from the

credit at once to the author's diligence in research and to his power of grasping
essential facts and of presenting them clearly and with a due sense of value.
