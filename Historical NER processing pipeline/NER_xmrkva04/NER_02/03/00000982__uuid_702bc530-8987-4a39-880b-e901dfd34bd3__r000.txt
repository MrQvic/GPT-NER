OOD generally shows when it is spoiled by an unpleasant look,
taste, or smell. It may, however, be contaminated with organ-
isms that make it unsafe for use, even though it still appears good.
The causes of spoilage are many and varied, and foods differ greatly
in the kind of care needed.
Foods may be spoiled by bacteria, yeasts, molds; by changes pro-
duced by heat and cold, light, and loss or absorption of moisture;
by insects and other household pests; and by parasites of food ani-
mals. Dirt and careless handling increase the chances of spoilage
at every stage from the time food is produced until finally used.
Right methods of care in the home can prevent or at least check
much waste from these causes. The waste of food through poor
choice, preparation, and serving is due to very different reasons and
is not discussed in this bulletin.
