â€ ' An incident highly characteristic of the English sailors
occurred in this action. In its voyage through the Mediter-
ranean, the French fleet had fallen in with, and captured
the brig Speedy, of fourteen guns, commanded by Captain
Lord COCHRANE, and that gallant officer, with his little
crew, was on board the Formidable when the action took
place in the Bay of Algesiraz. At every broadside the ves
sel received from the English, these brave men gave three
cheers, regardless alike of the threats of instant death from
the French if they continued so unseemly an interruption,
and the obvious danger that they themselves might be sen:
to the bottom by their friendly discharges.
