“It is of little moment," says Thibaudeau, “whether
Napoleon ordered the seizure of the pope: he did not disap-
prove of it; he profited by it, and took upon himself its whole
responsibility. His alleged discontent at Schoenbrunn, when
he received intelligence of the event, proves nothing: it
might be part of his views to make it be believed it was done
without his authority, and that he only undertook the scan-
dal of the transaction because it was irreparable."—THI-
BAUDEAU, vii., 507.
