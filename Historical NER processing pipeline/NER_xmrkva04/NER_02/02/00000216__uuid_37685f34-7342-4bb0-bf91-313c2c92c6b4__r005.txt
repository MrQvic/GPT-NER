† The instructions of Mr. Adair, the British ambassador
at Vienna at that period, were, not to stimulate Instructions to
the Austrian government to hurry into a war, Mr. Adair on
of which the consequences, if unsuccessful, the subject.
might be fatal to that country, but to offer its government,
if they deemed the opportunity favourable for engaging in
hostilities, or if the necessities of their situation compelled
them to such a course, the whole pecuniary aid which Great
Britain was capable of affording. Of the wisdom of this
course of proceeding, no one who considers the precarious
situation of Austria at that crisis can entertain a doubt; and
it affords another proof of the clear insight which Mr. Fox
at that period had obtained into the insatiable ambition of
Napoleon, and of the magnanimity with which that upright
statesman instantly acted upon his conviction. “A man,"
says the Marquis Lucchesini, “ unjustly styled by Napoleon
and his adherents the last prop of the pacific dispositions
of the cabinet of St.James."— Vide LUCCHESINI, ii., 96, 97,
