lament your absence, offer your services; they will be ac-
cepted, and you will gain a quiet heart by it. You will
gain a glorious victory, and then you may return here and
be happy." He looked at her with tears in his eyes:
" Brave Emma! good Emma! If there were more Emmas
there would be more Nelsons."—SOUTHEY, ii., 232.
* “ Friday night, Sept. 13, half past ten. I drove from
dear, dear Merton, where I left all which I hold dear in this
world, to go and serve my king and country. May the great
God whom I adore enable me to fulfil the expectations of
my country! and if it is His good pleasure that I should re-
turn, my thanks will never cease being offered up to the
throne of His mercy. If it is His good providence to cut
short my days upon earth, I bow with the greatest submis-
sion, relying that He will protect those so dear to me whom
I leave behind. His will be done!"—SOUTHEY, ii., 235.
