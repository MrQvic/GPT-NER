Book II—The Krishna Cult—In this book the compiler has
given extracts from the writings of the followers of Vallabha-
charya including Sur Das and others commonly known as Asht
Chhap, Nabhaji Gokul Nath, the oldest prose writer, and Dhruva
Das. These writers have described loves of Krishna and Radha
in a religious spirit and have nothing in common with ordinary
writers of erotic poetry. No other book has yet been published
in Hindi in which the curious reader may find the hymns of each
of the Asht Chhap with notices of the authors. Royal 8vo
