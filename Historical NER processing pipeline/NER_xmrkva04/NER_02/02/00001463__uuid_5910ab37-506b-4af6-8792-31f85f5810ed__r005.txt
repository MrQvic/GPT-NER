* The instructions of the Aulic Council in the outset of
the campaign were, “ to advance in large masses, and attack
the French army wherever it might assemble, either on the
Main, the Nab, or the Danube. Should a French corps
enter Bavaria, the grand Austrian army was not to swerve
from its direction, but trust to arresting the movement on
Bavaria, by threatening the advancing corps on the side of
Ratisbon or Donauwerth. If Marshal Davoust retired in
order to avoid any engagement before the arrival of his re-
enforcements, the grand Austrian army was, nevertheless, to
continue its advance with all possible expedition, and take
up a central position between the Black Forest and the Main,
and there be regulated by the forces of the enemy, and the
chances of successful operations which were afforded. The
issue of the war depends on this operation and on the issue
of the first battle, which will, in all probability, if success-
ful, rouse the malecontents of Bareuth, overawe Saxony,
and bring round to the standards of Austria great part of the
troops of the Confederation of the Rhine which are now ar-
rayed against her."—STUTTERHEIM, 64-69; PELET, i
