The faculty of rapidly withdrawing the mind from one
subject and fixing it on another of a different description, is
one of the surest marks of the highest class of intellectual
powers. Of this a remarkable instance occurred at this pe-
riod: for Wellington, on the day when he lay at San Chris-
toval, in front of the French army, hourly expecting a bat-
tle, wrote out in the field a long and minute memorial on
the establishment of a bank at Lisbon on the principles of
the English ones.—See WELLINGTON to SIR CHARLES
STUART, 25th June, 1812, GURWoOD, ix., 249.
