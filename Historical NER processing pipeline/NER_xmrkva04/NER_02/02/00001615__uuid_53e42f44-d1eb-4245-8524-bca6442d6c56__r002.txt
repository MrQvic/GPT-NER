Thus the committals in Ireland had increased a half in
six years after the disabilities were removed from the Cath-
olics. When it is recollected that not a third part of the
atrocious crimes in that country are ever made the subject
either of committal or trial, it may safely be concluded,
from this instructive table, that during that period crime
has more than doubled over its whole extent.â€”See Parl.
