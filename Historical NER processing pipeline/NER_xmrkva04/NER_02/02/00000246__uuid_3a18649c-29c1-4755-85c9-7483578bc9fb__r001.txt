* This admirable painting, the master-piece of modern
French art, is to be seen in the Luxembourg, at Paris, stand-
ing forth in dark simplicity amid its meretricious compeers:
it is worthy to be placed beside the finest battle-pieces of Le
Brun or Tempesta, and in grandeur of thought and of effect
greatly excels any British work of art since the days of
Reynolds.
