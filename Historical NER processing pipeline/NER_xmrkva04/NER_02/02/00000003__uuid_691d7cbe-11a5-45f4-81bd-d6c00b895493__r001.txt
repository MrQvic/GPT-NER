It is not to be supposed that the Revolutionary govern-
ments had done nothing for education. On the contrary,
the Polytechnic School, and many other institutions, par-
ticularly a school of medicine, and the Institute itself, were
owing to their exertions. But in the distracted state of the
country, and when the care of self-preservation came home
to every one, little attention could be paid to the education
of the young; and, by destroying every sort of religious tu-
ition, the Convention had cut off the right hand of public
instruction, the only branch of it which is of paramount im-
portance to the poor.—See THIB., 123.
