be found, in a great measure, in the heavy duties
on British colonial produce, amounting at first
to 30s., then to 27s., and latterly to 24s. on each
hundred weight of sugar, from which the foreign
growers were exempted in the supply of foreign
markets. This enormous burden, which, on an
average of prices since 1820, has been nearly 75
per cent. on that species of produce, has, notwith-
standing all their efforts, for the most part, if not
entirely, fallen on the producers.*
Nor is this all: the precipitate and irretrievable
step of emancipation, forced on the Legislature
by benevolent but incautious, and, perhaps, mis-
taken feeling, has already occasioned so great a
decline in the produce of the British West In-
dies, and excited such general expectations of a
still greater and increasing deficiency, that the
impulse thereby given to the foreign slave-trade
to fill up the gap has been unbounded, and, it is
to be feared, almost irremediable.â€
