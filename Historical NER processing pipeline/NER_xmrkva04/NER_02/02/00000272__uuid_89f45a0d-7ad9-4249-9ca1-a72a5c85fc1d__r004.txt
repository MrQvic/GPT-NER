Bavarians; I look, therefore, for an affair every minute;
nevertheless, it is now noon, and I have not heard the can-
non. You will perceive at a glance that I am refusing my
left to throw forward my right, which you form, and which
to-day should enter into action. Push Oudinot forward to
Neustadt. From thence I shall probably direct the 4th
corps to Landshut; and then Prince Charles, attacked on
his left, will find he has lost his line of operations upon
the Iser. Everything will be cleared up to-day; the mo-
ments are precious; hours must be counted. Twelve or
fifteen thousand of such rabble as you have defeated this
morning should be easily disposed of by six thousand of ou-
people.3â€”NAPOLEON to MASSENA, 19th April, 1809; PE
