1813, and 1814, as well as the letters of Napoleon contained in
Napier's Account of the Peninsular War, some idea may be
formed of the prodigious mental activity of a man who, amid
all the cares of empire, and all the distractions of almost in-
cessant warfare, contrived, during the twenty years that he
held the reins of power, to write or dictate probably more
than the united works of Lope de Vega, Voltaire, and Sir
Walter Scott. His secret and confidential correspondence
with the Directory, published at Paris in 1819, from 1796
to 1798 only, a work of great interest and rarity, amounts to
seven large closely-printed volumes; and his letters to his
generals, during that time, must have been twice as volu-
minous.
