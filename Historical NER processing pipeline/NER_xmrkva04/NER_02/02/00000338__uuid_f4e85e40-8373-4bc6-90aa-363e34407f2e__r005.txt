It is not going too far to say, that the sums drawn during
these years, directly or indirectly, by plunder, contributions,
tribute in subsidies from foreign states, amounted to at least
half as much more; and the sums, from the difference in
the value of money, were equal to almost double their nom-
inal amount in the currency of Great Britain. Thus, during
the last six years of Napoleon, an expenditure equal to near-
ly a hundred millions sterling in England took place in the
French Empire, of which more than a third was drawn from
foreign countries. It is not surprising that such a govern-
ment for the time should be popular, notwithstanding its des-
potic character and the conscription.
