† Augereau, at Valence, on the Rhone, thus addressed
his soldiers: “Soldiers! The Senate, the just interpreter of
the national will, worn out with the despotism of Bona-
parte, has pronounced, on the 2d of April, the dethrone-
ment of him and his family. A new dynasty, strong and
liberal, descended from our ancient kings, will replace Bona-
parte and his despotism. Soldiers! you are absolved from
your oaths; you are so by the nation, in which the sover-
eignty resides: you are still more so, were it necessary, by
the abdication of a man who, after having sacrificed mill-
ions to his cruel ambition, has not known how to die as a
soldier.—AUGEREAU, 16th April."—Moniteur, 23d April,
1814.
