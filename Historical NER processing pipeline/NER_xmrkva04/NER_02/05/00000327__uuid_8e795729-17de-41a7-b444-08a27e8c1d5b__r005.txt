† Napoleon, says Rapp, no sooner arrived in sight of
Okernin than he reconnoitred the position of the Russians,
and the plain which it was necessary to pass before arriving
at the river. Covered with woods, intersected by marshes,
it was almost as difficult to traverse as the fieldworks,
which were bristling with Cossacks, were to carry on the
opposite bank. The emperor surveyed them long and with
close attention; but, as the thickets of wood in some places
intercepted his view, he caused a ladder to be brought, and
ascended to the roof of a cottage, where he completed his
observations. He then said, “ It will do—send an officer;"
and, when he arrived, dictated on the spot the minute direc-
tions for the movement of all the corps during the opera-
tion, which are preserved in Dumas, xvii., 137.— Vide
