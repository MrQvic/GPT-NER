and rewarded with two-and-twenty articles of impeach-
ment. He (Mr. M.) would not enter on the proceedings
which distressed and harassed the feelings of that great
man: they were at an end, and the feelings which excited
them and that great man himself were now no more; but
this he thought himself allowed to say, that those proceed-
ings were contrary to the practice and spirit of the laws of
this happy nation."
It was unanimously resolved, “That, as the last testi-
mony of approbation of the long, zealous, and successful
services of the late Right Hon. Warren Hastings, in main-
taining, without diminution, the British possessions in India
against the combined efforts of European, Mohammedan,
and Mahratta enemies, the statue of that distinguished ser-
vant of the East India Company be placed among the
statesmen and heroes who have contributed, in their sever-
al stations, to the recovery, preservation, and security of
the British power and authority in India."—See AUBER, i.,
