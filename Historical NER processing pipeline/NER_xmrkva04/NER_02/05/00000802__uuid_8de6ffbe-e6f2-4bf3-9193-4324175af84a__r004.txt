* South., Pen. War, i., 73.
† The appointment of General Whitelocke over the head
of Sir Samuel Auchmuty, the hero of Monte Video, appears
the strongest confirmation of these remarks, but in reality it
is not so; for that town was stormed on Feb. 2, and General
Whitelocke's appointment is dated March 5, in the same
year; so that the one was not known till the other took
place. It is the overlooking the many officers who had dis
tinguished themselves in Egypt, Maida, and India, which
forms the real reproach to the British government on this
occasion.
