Thus, in the twenty-four years from 1792 to 1816, the circulation of England, including the large and small notes and
commercial paper discounted at the Bank, was more than tripled; the revenue tripled, and the exports more than doubled;
the imports increased a half. The increase of commercial paper from 1792 to 1810 was sevenfold: indicating, perhaps,
the greatest and most rapid rise in mercantile transactions in the whole history of the world.
