The clause regarding Malta, which became of so much
importance in the sequel, from being the ostensible ground
of the rupture of the treaty, was in these terms: “ The
island of Malta, with its dependancies, shall be evacuated
by the English troops, and restored to the order of St. John
of Jerusalem. To secure the absolute independence of that
isle from both the contracting parties, it shall be placed un-
der the guarantee of a third power, to be named in the defin-
itive treaty."—DUMAS, vii., 319, and Parl. Hist., xxxV.,
