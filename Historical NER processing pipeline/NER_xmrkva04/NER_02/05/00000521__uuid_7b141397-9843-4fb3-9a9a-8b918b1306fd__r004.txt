* The taxes had become most oppressive. All the old
imposts, though nominally repealed, were, in fact, collected
as rigidly as before, and, in addition to them, a multitude
of new duties on corn, oil, meat, and vegetables. Forced
loans had repeatedly been exacted from the wealthier class-
es; and a tax, first of eight, then ten. then fifteen per cent.,
had been imposed on all houses. Employment there was
none. The hospitals were crowded with sick and starving
poor; and of the persons who had died in the first six months
of 1812, two thirds had perished of actual want.—SOUTH-
