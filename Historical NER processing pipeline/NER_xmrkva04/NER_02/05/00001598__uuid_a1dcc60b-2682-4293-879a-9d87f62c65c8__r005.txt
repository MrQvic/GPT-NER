Chatterji's Origin and Development of the Bengali Language is positively a
master-piece; I know of no work of this kind where the matter has been so
fully mastered, so thoroughly searched, so clearly exposed. Any scholar in-
terested in any side of Bengali, even of Indian history or life is sure to find
there enrichment of knowledge and appeal to reflexion.
