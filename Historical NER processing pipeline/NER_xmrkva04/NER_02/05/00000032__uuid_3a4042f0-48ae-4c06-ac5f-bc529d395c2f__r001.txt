* “ D'York's defection," said Metternich to M. Otto, “ af-
fords an instance of what I have so often directed your at-
tention to, the graca fides of the Russians, and the embar-
rassing situation in which, in consequence, the greater part
of sovereigns are placed, in respect to their troops and their
subjects. Metternich appears to me to labour under the ap-
prehension that the defection of the Prussian troops may be-
come the signal of a revolution, in consequence of which the
Russians will profit with their ordinary astuteness, by the
first impression which it may create in Poland and Germa-
ny."—COUNT OTTO to MARET, 11th of Jan., 1813. FAIN,
