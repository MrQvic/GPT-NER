* Napoleon spoke thus of this fortress: “The citadel of
Spandau, situated on the Spree, fully victualled for two
months, is an inestimable acquisition. In our hands it
could sustain two months of open trenches. But such was
the general confusion that the batteries were not even arm-
ed."—19th Bulletin. It is evident that treachery, or self-
ishness equivalent to treachery, occasioned the sudden fall
of so many of the Prussian fortresses at this period; and
Bignon tells us that he became convinced of that when, on
being sent by the emperor to superintend the capitulation
of Spandau, he found the governor, Benckendorf, occupied
with no other consideration but disputes with the French
commander as to some wretched culinary articles which he
alleged the capitulation authorized him to remove!—BIG-
