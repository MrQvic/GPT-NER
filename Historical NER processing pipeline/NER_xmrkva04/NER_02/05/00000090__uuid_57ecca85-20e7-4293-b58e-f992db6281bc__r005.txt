ened us by the loss of 1500 men. Soldiers, this astonishing
success is owing to your boundless confidence in your em-
peror; to your patience in undergoing fatigues; to your rare
intrepidity! But we will not rest here. Already I see you
are burning to commence a second campaign. The gold of
England has brought against us the Russian army from the
extremities of the universe; we will make it undergo the
same fate. To that combat is, in an especial manner, at-
tached the honour of the French infantry. It is there that
is to be decided for the second time that question, already
resolved in Switzerland and Holland, whether the French
infantry is the first or second in Europe. There are no gen-
erals there whom it would add to my glory to vanquish. All
my care shall be to obtain the victory with as little an
effusion of blood as possible. My soldiers are my children."
Amid his customary exaggeration there was much truth in
this proclamation.â€”RAPP, 47, 48.
