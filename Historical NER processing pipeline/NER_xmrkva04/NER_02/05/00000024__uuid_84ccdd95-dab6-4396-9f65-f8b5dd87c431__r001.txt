An ancient Sanscrit text says, â€˜ Creatures all have come from A; firmly stand they
now in O; all was dark when all was M; S will set the whole thing free. Even mystic
Aum is nought, if not under Siva brought." The emblem of Siva is a perpendicular mark;
that of Vishnu a horizontal with three short verticals.
