The work is a brilliant exposition of the Sankara-School of
the Vedanta Philosophy. The most striking feature of the work
is the full consideration of various altogether new issues such as
â€”(1) whether Sankara has denied the reality of the objects of
the universe, (2) whether individuality has been resolved in his
system of Philosophy into mere relations and actions and
whether the Ego cannot be held to be an active power, (3)
whether Vedanta advocates inertia, emptying of the human
mind rather than its expansion, (4) whether Sankara's Theory
can be called Pantheism, (5) what is the relation between Being
and Not-Being; and between Infinite and Finite, (6) what is the
place of Ethics and Religion, (7) what is the correct view on
Vedantic Mukti, and such other valuable topics. The work will
prove an indispensable companion for the thorough and correct
understanding of the great Maya-Vada in its various aspects.
