Antichrist-line. A. 10 horns from the sea: 180° and 45°. B. The lamb from the
earth with two horns: 45°. Before the extra horn 3 of the former fall, placing his
advent 221/2° inside the present cycle (from 619 a.C.) Reckoning by means of the
7 heads, the 6th 221/2° closes, then, with 619, the 7th continues to 2239, and the 8th
for one hour=381/2°. By both methods we arrive at the same result, namely 5000
a.C. The heads, however, indicate a house which originated 9100 B.C., but was
commencing with the 5th horn, or the second square, i.e., the last 90° of the present
half-circle, as far as the four rulers, expressed by symbols (lion, No. 2, or with two
wings; bear No. 3,—three ribs, &c.) are concerned. Ruling thus for 215 genera-
tions, they return 115, and among these the builders of the tower of Babel, which
existed 42 generations before the time of Nebuchadrezzar.
