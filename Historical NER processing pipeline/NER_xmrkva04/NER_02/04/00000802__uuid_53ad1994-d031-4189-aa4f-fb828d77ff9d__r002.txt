 The work reflects the highest credit on its late author. It contains a
vast mass of carefully verified information lucidly arranged and expounded
and it is invaluable to every serious student of Indian Logic. It must for a
very long period form an indispensable source of material for workers in the
field of Indian Philosophy, and whatever difference there may be with the
views of the author, whether in principle or in detail, they cannot possibly
obscure the permanent value of a work which—as any one familiar with
Indian Logic knows only too well—must have involved almost endless labour.
The University of Calcutta is to be congratulated on the fact that it was
found possible to produce the book despite the author's death before its com-
pletion, and the thanks of scholars are due to it for the production of the
work in such effective and enduring form."
