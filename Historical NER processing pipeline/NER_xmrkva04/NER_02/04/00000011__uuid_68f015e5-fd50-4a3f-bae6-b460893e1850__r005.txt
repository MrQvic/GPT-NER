* “ The number of slaves landed in Cuba and Brazil
alone," said Mr. Buxton, the able and humane advocate of
the negro race, “is 150,000, being more than double the
whole draught on Africa when the slave-trade controversy
began. Twice as many human beings are now its victims
as when Wilberforce and Clarkson began their noble task;
and each individual of this increased number, in addition to
the horrors formerly endured, is cribbed up in a smaller
space, and stowed in a vessel where accommodation is sac-
rificed to spoil."—African Slave-trade, by T. F. BUXTOV
London, 1839, p. 172.
