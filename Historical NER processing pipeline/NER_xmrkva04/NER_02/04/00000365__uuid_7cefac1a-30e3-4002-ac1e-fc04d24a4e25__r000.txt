Comparative Religion (Stephanos Nirmalendu Ghosh Lec-
tures delivered in the Calcutta University in 1923; pub-
lished in July, 1925), by Prof. A. A. Macdonell,
M.A. (Oxon.), Ph.D. (Leipzig), D.Litt. (Edin.), D.O.L.
(Calcutta). Royal 8vo pp. 194. 1925. Rs. 3.
The work is the first course of lectures on Comparative
Religion delivered under the auspices of the Stephanos
Nirmalendu Ghosh foundation. The author has given a survey,
in eight lectures, of all the important religions of antiquity, in-
cluding an introductory one on â€˜ Primitive Religion.' They em-
brace Confucianism, Zoroastrianism, Brahmanism (including
Buddhism), Greek religion, Judaism, Muhammadanism and
Christianity. These religions are treated objectively, not from
the point of view of any particular one. It has been shown
what they have in common, and to what extent each approaches
universality, to the outlook of a world religion.
