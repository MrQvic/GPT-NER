* The reasons assigned by Napoleon in the Council of
State for the employment of the ancient in preference to the
modern noblesse was as follows: “It is among the old fam-
:lies that you can alone find still some remains of great for-
tune; by that means they exercise a great influence on
government. How could you compose a court with the men
of the Revolution? You find in their ranks only honourable
functionaries without fortune, or opulent contractors with-
out character: a court of salaried officials would be at once
onerous to the state, and without dignity in the eyes of the
people. If the old fortunes are divided by distributions on
death, they are restored by successions: the new fortunes
have nothing to look to in that way; on the contrary, they
are surrounded with needy relatives. Government can now
no longer enrich, as formerly, its servants by the domains of
the crown or confiscations; it ought, therefore, as much as
possible, to take advantage of fortunes already made, and
employ them in its rervice."—PELET, Conseil d' Etat de
Napoleon, 107, 108.
