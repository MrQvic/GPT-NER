pal reasons which induced me not to agree to peace at Cha-
tillon. If they would have left it to me, peace would have
been concluded. France, without the frontiers of the
Rhine and Antwerp, is nothing.â€œ All the difficulties at-
tendant on the situation were nothing in the eyes of Napo-
leon: in his impatience to make the English feel the dan-
gers of the Scheldt, which they had themselves often
signalized as so formidable, he was indefatigable; and in
less than eight years Antwerp had become a maritime ar-
senal of first-rate importance, and contained a considerable
fleet."* When Napoleon made these energetic remarks at
St. Helena, he was far from anticipating that, in twelve
years, a British squadron was to aid a French army to
wrest this magnificent fortress from the ally of England,
and restore it to the son-in-law of France and the sway of
the tricolour flag!
