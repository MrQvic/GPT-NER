+ “I have much satisfaction in acquainting your lordship
that the very handsome appearance and perfect discipline
of the troops under the orders of the Hon. Colonel Welles-
ley do honour to themselves and to him, while the judicious
and masterly arrangements as to supplies, which opened
an abundant free market, and inspired confidence in deal-
ers of every description, were no less creditable to Colonel
Wellesley than advantageous to the public service, and de-
servedly entitle him to my marked approbation." How
early is the real character of great men shown when once
thrown into important situations! This might have passed
for a description of Wellington's arrangements for the sup-
ply of his army in the south of France in spring, 1814.—
