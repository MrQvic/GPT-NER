† The physical difficulties experienced by the assailants in
this memorable siege were of the most formidable descrip-
tion; its details, which are fully given by General Mathieu
Dumas, are highly interesting to the military reader. No
less than 120,000 cannon-shot and 22,000 bombs were fired
by the garrison upon the besiegers before they returned a
single gun; but when their batteries were opened on the
10th of Julv. the superiority of their fire became soon ap-
parent. Gaeta, named after the nurse of Æneas,* under-
went a desperate siege from the Austrians in 1707, when it
surrendered only after a murderous assault by Marsnar
Dam. Thirty years afterward it was besieged and taken,
when defended only by an insufficient garrison.—See Du-
MAS, XV., 155, 170.
