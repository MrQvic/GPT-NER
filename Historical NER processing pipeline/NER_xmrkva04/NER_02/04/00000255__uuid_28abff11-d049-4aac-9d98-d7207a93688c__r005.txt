† “I never was so much struck with anything in my life,"
said General Bertrand at St. Helena, “ as by the emperor at
Eylau at the moment when, alone with some officers of his
staff, he was almost trodden under foot by a column of four
or five thousand Russians. The emperor was on foot, and
Berthier gave orders instantly for the horses to be brought
forward; the emperor gave him a reproachful look, and, in-
stead, ordered a battalion of his guard, which was at a lit-
tle distance, to advance. He himself kept his ground as the
Russians approached, repeating frequently the words, What
boldness! what boldness!" At the sight of the grenadiers
of his guard the Russians made a dead pause; the emper-
or did not stir, but all around him trembled."— LAS CASAS,
