The Indian Review (of Madras):—“............The present work under
review is an able treatise aiming to simplify and popularise the difficult system
of Adwaita philosophy, and the learned author has endeavoured to furnish
the Student and the general reader with the right views about the teachings
of Sankara on each of the topics treated therein. No pains have been spared
to make the work a suitable introduction to the study of Vedanta.........an
indispensable companion for any full understanding of Sankara's position.....
