+ “In agreeing to this proposal for an armistice," says Ku-
tusoff, in his official account of the transaction, “I had in
my view nothing but to gain time, and thereby obtain the
means of removing to a greater distance from the enemy, and
saving my army. The adjutant-general, Winzingerode, sent
me a duplicate of the proposed convention for my ratifica-
tion; without affixing my signature, I delayed my answer
for twenty hours, waiting for that of the French emperor,
and, meanwhile, caused the main body of the army to con-
tinue its retreat, which thereby gained two marches on the
enemy. In so doing, I was well aware that I was exposing
the corps of Prince Bagrathion to almost certain ruin; but I
esteemed myself fortunate in being able to save the army by
the destruction of that corps."—DUMAS, xiv., 48.
