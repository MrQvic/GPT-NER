+ Prince Mechercki wrote a letter to Paul in the early
part of that day to warn him of his danger, and reveal the
names of the conspirators. He delivered the letter into the
hands of Koutaitsoff, another courtier, who put it in his
coat pocket, and forgot it there when he changed his dress
to dine with the emperor. He returned to get it; but Paul,
growing impatient, sent for him in a hurry, and the trem-
bling courtier came back without the epistle on which so
much depended.â€”HARD., viii., 6.
