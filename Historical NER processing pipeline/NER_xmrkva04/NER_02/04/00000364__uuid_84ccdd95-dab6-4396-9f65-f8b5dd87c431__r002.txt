Now in Rev. 6, 9 the dead are underneath the altar, i. e., in the apron (5. seal), but
11, 1 they are within the altar, so that in the meantime a division must have happened,
which (14, 14) had extended to a disconnection between altar and temple. The city is
given up for 42 months (1 zodiac sign is to the semicircle as 21 to 129 (06); two z — s. =
42: 129). But however much the ancients taught a distinction between the off-face of
the cube and the true face, they refrained from predicting beyond their own time and
generation, and even maintained that, with the 3 part of the 7th zodiac sign “restraint“
is past. This is the import of the Jewish definition of what will occur during the 7th
zodiac sign (under the allegory of the 1. and 7. month, although the 7th month may have
a larger application).
