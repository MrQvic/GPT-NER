wrappers into the bread box not only is an untidy practice but
defeats this purpose.
Baked goods, and in fact all cereal products, have a remarkable
capacity for absorbing and giving off moisture. For instance, if
moist bread or cake and dry crackers or cookies are stored in the
same container, the moisture will tend to pass to the drier kind.
Crackers and crisp cookies are best kept in separate tight boxes or
jars to prevent their absorbing moisture from the air or any damp
material near them.
