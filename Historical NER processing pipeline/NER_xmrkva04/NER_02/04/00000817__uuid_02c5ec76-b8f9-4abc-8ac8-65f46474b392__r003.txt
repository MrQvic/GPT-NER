SECTION FIVE
Compensation
Article 18
1. For losses of property caused by nationalization,
compensation is due, and its amount will be fixed by
the Minister of Finance.
2. Shareholders owning the capital of a domestic
joint-stock company are entitled to compensation based
on the official prices of the assets and liabilities of the
nationalized company, no account being taken of the
value of the connection of the company or of funds
set aside for social, charitable and similar purposes.
The official prices on which the balance-sheet as per
December 31, 1944, was based, are decisive. If these
prices are not available, an official valuation of the
assets and liabilities should be made.
