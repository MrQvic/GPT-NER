vainly expecting your succours for an entire year, have
taught us what is the worth of English friendship."—See
DUMAS, xix., 171.
* The summons set forth: “To convince the Danish
government and the whole world of the reluctance with
which his majesty has recourse to arms, we, the undersign-
ed, at the moment when our troops are before your gates,
and our batteries ready to open, renew to you the offer of
the same advantageous terms which we formerly proposed:
viz., if you will consent to deliver up the Danish fleet, and
to our carrying it away, it shall be held in deposite merely,
and restored in as good a state as received, with all its
equipments, as soon as the provisions of a general peace
shall have removed the necessity which occasioned this de-
mand. But, if this offer is now rejected, it cannot be re-
peated."—CATHCART, GAMBIER, Sept. 1, 1807.
