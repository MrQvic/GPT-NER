† The determination to refuse the ratification of the treaty
signed at Paris by D'Oubril was taken at St. Petersburg on
the 25th of August; the Dneister was passed on the 23d of
November. The resolution to provoke a Turkish war,
therefore, was taken after it was known that a continued
struggle with the enemy, whose strength they had felt at
Austerlitz, had become inevitable.—Ante., ii., 429.
