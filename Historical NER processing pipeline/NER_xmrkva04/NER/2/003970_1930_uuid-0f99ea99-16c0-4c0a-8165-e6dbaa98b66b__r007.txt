The causes of famine and remedies against it have been
elaborately discussed in this book and a statistical information
adduced shewing the financial effect of the calamity and its rela-
tion to mortality. The author shows by facts and arguments as
also by quoting several extracts from official records that true
remedies lie in the hands of Government.
