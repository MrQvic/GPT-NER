following week's ration in ad-
vance. And—complained the
Prague Nazi paper Der Neue Tag
on 7th May, 1942—if the shop-
keeper has no stock in hand, the
people offer him their coupons in
advance in order to secure the
goods when they arrive.
There is an important reserva-
tion in the case of all the rationed
foodstuffs: the rations are not
guaranteed, but depend on avail-
able supplies. It frequently hap-
pens that no fats are supplied
for a week, without the consumer
being entitled to obtain the
ration concerned the following
week. There are supplementary
rations for heavy manual workers
but here again the supplements
are not always issued. Last year
many categories of workers were
altogether deprived of the right
to these supplementary rations.
