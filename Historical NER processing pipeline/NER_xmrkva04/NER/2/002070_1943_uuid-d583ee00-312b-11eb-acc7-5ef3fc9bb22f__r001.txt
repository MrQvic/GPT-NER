the normal German ration. They
are given two kilogrammes (412
pounds) bread weekly, and a
daily ration of 40 grammes (less
than 11/2 ozs.) sausage, sometimes
50 grammes (less than 2 ozs.)
meat, and a total weekly ration
of 250 grammes butter, lard and
margarine, in addition to potatoes
turnips or cabbage. No wonder
that none are keen to work under
such conditions, particularly in
view of the bad treatment.
