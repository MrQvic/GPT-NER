The authors describe five cases of thrombosis of
the carotid artery.
A woman of 53 with hemiplegia, a positive Was-
sermann reaction and thrombosis of the left carotid
artery, showed a significant difference in blood pres-
sure between the to arms and the authors were of
the opinion that the thrombus extended to the sub-
clavian artery. Arterectomy of the common carotid
artery was performed.
An obstruction of the carotid syphon in a woman
of 59 with hemiplegia and aphasia was detected by
percutaneous arteriography.
A spastic hemiparesis arose in a voman of 44, eight
years after head injury. Arteriography showed a
thrombosis of the internal carotid artery near to its
origin. The X-ray findings were verified by arter-
ectomy.
A man of 53 suffered a severe head injury 8 years
before the onset of quadruparesis, the progress of
which was very slow. Percutaneous arteriography
and subsequent arterectomy showed thrombosis of
both internal carotid arteries. The high blood pres-
sure in this patient may have some connection with
the thrombosis of both carotid sinuses.
