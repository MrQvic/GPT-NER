Food costs labor or money or both; therefore it should receive the
best care in the home. Moreover, clean food is necessary to health
and well-being. Some of the most important kinds are highly
perishable and require careful handling.
Food must be safeguarded from spoilage by bacteria, yeasts, and
molds, by changes produced by heat and cold, light, and loss or
absorption of moisture, by insects and household pests, and by ani-
mal parasites. The following are general rules for checking or
preventing food spoilage in the home:
All foods should be kept clean; that is, protected from visible dirt
and from contamination by insects and other carriers of dangerous
microorganisms. Most kinds should also be kept cool. Dry foods,
such as crackers, need to be prevented from absorbing moisture, and
succulent foods, such as fresh vegetables, from losing it.
Milk, fresh meat, poultry, and fish, and many fresh fruits and
vegetables should be kept at a temperature of 50Â° F. or preferably
less in order to check the growth of microorganisms that cause
souring and decay.
