that the Soviet Government never at any time had anything to do
with Munich, was against the policy which led to Munich, and therefore
does not recognize anything which took place there in relation to
Czechoslovakia, nor any consequences of the Munich policy in 1938
and 1939. And it would inform the Czechoslovak Government that
even in respect to the question of the Czechoslovak frontiers it does
not recognize any changes effected in 1938 and 1939. It takes its
stand on the pre-Munich Czechoslovak frontiers."
This was confirmed to President Bene≈° by M. Molotov, Commissar
for Foreign Affairs, in their conversation on June 9, 1942, in London.
Thus in 1942 the Munich Agreement ceased to operate as a valid
international document.
