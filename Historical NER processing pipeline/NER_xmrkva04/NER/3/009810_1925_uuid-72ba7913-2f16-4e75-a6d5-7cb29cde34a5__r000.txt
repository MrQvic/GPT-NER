The apparatus (see fig. 1. on p. 9.) consisted of a Jena glass
retort heated in an air bath controlled by a pyrometer. The retort
was connected air-tight with a condenser for tar and water, a series
of absorption bottles for H,S and CO,, and a gas-holder.
100 g of the air-dry coal were placed in the retort, and heated
very slowly to the desired temperature which was maintained constant
until no escaping of gas could be observed. The temperatures chosen
were 350 C, 450° C, 550° C, 600° C. At each cut the amount of tar,
water, H,S, CO, and gas was determined.
The separation of tar from water was effected by a centrifuge
(see fig. 2. on p. 13), H,S was determined as CdS, CO, by titration
with barium hydroxide.
The yields in tar, calculated on the basis moisture free and ash-
free coal, are tabulated below, for the particular range of temperature
and for the different sorts of coal:
