China—the fourth Great Power among the Allies—recognized the
Czechoslovak Government on August 27, 1941. By January, 1943, the
majority of the South and Central American States had joined the four
Great Powers. It was a considerable moral and political encouragement
for the Czechoslovak nation and its movement abroad when on
June 9, and September 28, 1942, the British and Soviet Governments
respectively decided that their Ministers accredited to the Czecho-
slovak Government should have the status of Ambassadors and that
the same should apply to the Czechoslovak Ministers to these Powers.
