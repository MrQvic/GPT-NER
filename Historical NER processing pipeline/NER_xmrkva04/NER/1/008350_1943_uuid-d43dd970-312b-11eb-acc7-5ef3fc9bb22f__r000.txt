important trades and in-
dustries in the Reich and
Bohemia-Moravia respec-
tively, shows that the Pro-
tectorate rates were on an
average approximately 20
per cent. below the corre-
sponding rates of the ad-
jacent parts of the Reich
(Silesia, Saxony, Central
Germany, Bavaria). As
compared with the Reich
average the difference is
still greater.... If we try
to take into account devia-
tions in the cost of living,
then the purchasing power
of the average hourly wage
in the Protectorate in the
middle of 1940 might have
been a further 15 to 20 per
cent. lower than was the case
in the neighbouring Gaus of
the old Reich territory."
