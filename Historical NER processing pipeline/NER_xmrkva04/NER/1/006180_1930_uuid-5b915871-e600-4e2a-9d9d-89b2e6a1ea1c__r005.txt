This monumental work of Prof. Winternitz is too well-known
to need any introduction to the public. In order to make it
accessible to those interested in Indian Literature but not well-
versed in German, the Calcutta University has undertaken the
publication of an English version. The whole work will occupy
several volumes. The second volume is now in the Press.
