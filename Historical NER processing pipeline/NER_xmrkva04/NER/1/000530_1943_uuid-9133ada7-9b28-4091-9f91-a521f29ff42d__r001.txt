When, on August 5, 1942, the British Government declared that it
no longer considered itself bound by the terms of the Munich Agree-
ment, and when, on October 28, the Government of the United States
recognized Dr. Bene≈° as the President of the Czechoslovak Republic,
and the Czechoslovak Government in London as an Allied Government
possessing full authority, the first phase of the exiled Government's
diplomatic activity came to an end. The second phase of these activi-
ties, aiming at the provision of the political and military means to
assure the future security of the Continent of Europe and thus of
Czechoslovakia as well, is at present, in autumn, 1943, when the twenty-
fifth anniversary of the creation of the first Czechoslovak Republic is
being celebrated by Czechoslovaks all over the world, far from being
completed. In their hearts they hope that the endeavours of their
Government will this time secure them a longer period of happy
independence.
