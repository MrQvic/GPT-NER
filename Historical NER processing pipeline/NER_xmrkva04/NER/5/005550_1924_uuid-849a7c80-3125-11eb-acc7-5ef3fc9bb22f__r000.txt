time was drawing near, there was still some food and clothing left,
which it was not thought advisable to distribute among the po-
pulation any more. It was, therefore, decided to give it to the most
important institutions i. e. schools and hospitals and to those fa-
milies that depended on the Čsl. help alone. The district school in
Alexejevka, where both the central ware-house and kitchen were
located, also needed some means for completing its building and the
buying of the most important fixtures. The school-management was
then given 136 pud of sugar, valued at 4 billion and 800 million
of Sov. roubles, from which the expenditure for finishing the buil-
ding were paid. Furthermore, the public school connected with the
agricultural institute at Kinčl received 125 pud of sugar worth
3 bil., 714 million Sov. roubles to enable it to pay for the upkeep
of three teachers, one man-of-all-work and for some school-requi-
sites, the necessary fuel and part support of the school-children.
