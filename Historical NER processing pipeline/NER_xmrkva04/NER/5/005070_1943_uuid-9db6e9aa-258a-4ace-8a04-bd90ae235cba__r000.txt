1 It was chiefly the Czechoslovak fighter pilots who were given the first
opportunity to take an active part in operations against the enemy. First they
fought alongside the Polish Air Force in 1939 when 55 of them were awarded the
Polish Military Cross; then, fighting the Luftwaffe over the French and Belgian
fronts in 1940, they destroyed in May and June alone 148 enemy aircraft, either
single-handed or in co-operation, besides achieving a number of notable successes
in attacks on German tank and motor transport concentrations. The most
prominent were the ace pilots Captain V. and Lieut. P., who were credited with
shooting down 15 and 14 enemy aircraft respectively. Seventy Croix de Guerre,
seven Legions d'honneur, and five Medailles militaires, besides a number of
mentions in dispatches were awarded to the few Czechoslovak fighter pilots who
were fortunate enough to fly operationally in France.
