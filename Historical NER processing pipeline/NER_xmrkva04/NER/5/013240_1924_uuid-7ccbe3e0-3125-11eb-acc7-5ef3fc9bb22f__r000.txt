experiments and analyses were executed by them. On the average
there were 9 experiments for each member.
Even the library had the character of a circle and became a
reading room at the same time. The duties of librarians were execu-
ted by 12 pupils of the 8th class. They took turns on accepting
and issuing books, keeping of catalogues and other entries and at
the same time had to see that everything was clean and tidy. They
tidied up themselves and attended to the heating of the library.
The library had originally 2500 books, but already in February
1922 some more books were brought from the funds given by the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs*).
