9,613 were in political protective
custody, and 43,284 simply in
concentration camps. That is
how the Germans have kept
their promise concerning Czech
self-administration.
To an Englishman or American
it must be horrible even to hear
about these atrocities, and even
to imagine that such things are
still possible in the twentieth
century. But the Czech workers
are bearing all this persecution
and assuming all the sacrifices
involved unflinchingly, for they
know that they cannot live with-
out freedom. But there is one
appeal that they address to us
amidst their torment: See to it
that the hour of victory should
come soon, for otherwise you will
only be liberating a cemetery!
