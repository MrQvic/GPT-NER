Summary.
A comparsion of the therapy of placenta praevia
from 1908—1948 is made. During that period a very
considerable improvement occurred. This was due
to increased ante-natal care, more conservative the-
rapy combined with the ommission of vaginal exa-
minations, transfer to a hospital, improvement in the
technique and widening of the indications for Cae-
sarian section, a better control of bloodloss, the wider
use blood transfusion and an improvement in the
therapy of puerperal infection.
In this way the maternal death-rate was decreased
from 8—10 6 — 2,7% and even to 0,6%. The infantile
death-rate was reduced from 80% to 32,7  and even
to less than 25%. These results may be further im-
proved by the extension of ante natal care to include
all pregnant women. Only by this means can the
immediate transfer of women to hospital at the onset
of haemorrhage be assured.
