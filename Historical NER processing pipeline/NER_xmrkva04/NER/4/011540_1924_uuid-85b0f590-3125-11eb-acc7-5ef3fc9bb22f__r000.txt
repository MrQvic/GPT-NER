about the Czechoslovak state was greatly changed. Applications
have reached the Czechoslovak authorities in which the Czech set-
tlers expressed their wish to learn the Czech language correctly.
They were keen to get Czech teachers, Czech books and news-
papers, particularly those referring to agriculture.
Those belonging to other nationalities, namely Germans,
looked upon the Czechoslovak Relief activity with astonishment
and esteem.
The native people, such as Ukrainians and Russians, appre-
ciated greatly the help rendered, especially the unselfish and
kind spirit in which it was given. At first the Czechoslovak Re-
lief met with great mistrust on part of those who did not ap-
prove of foreign help and were trying to compromise the Czecho-
slovak Relief activities in a secret way, by causing them all kind
of difficulties. In spite of this all obstacles were overcome. The
Czechoslovak modest and unassuming way of rendering help
might have been perhaps explained and understood in a wrong
way, for even the service of the Press was omitted, by which other
organizations were trying to win the good graces of the Press for
themselves.
