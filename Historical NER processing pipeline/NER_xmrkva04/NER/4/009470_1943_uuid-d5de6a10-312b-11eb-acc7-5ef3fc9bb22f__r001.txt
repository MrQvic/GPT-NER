Where long waiting is necessary,
the workers having to be present,
but doing no actual work, the
working day is fixed at twelve
hours. Stoppages of work
occurring on one day may be
made good, without limitation,
the next day. Further extensions
of the working day, that is,
beyond twelve hours, are per-
missible, though only with special
official permission. Once every
three weeks a continuous shift of
sixteen hours is permitted.
